I had to substitute several ingredients. For Mike's Hot Honey, I used honey + pepper flakes; Cardamom, I used 5 spice. Cook time was 22 minutes or a little longer. I would make this again!

5/5 with important modifications.
I made this recipe twice some time ago, but hadn't made it in at least a year before trying it again a few days ago. The first time pretty good. The second time, the carrots had completely dried out and weren't very good. This last time, I modified the cooking process, which made them wonderful. Read on for my changes.
Firstly, I just mix all the ingredients together. No need to leave out the orange juice, salt, or pepper until the end.

I got ahead of myself and didn't read all of the recipe. I combined all of the ingredients but it still worked out really deliciously good. Next time I will follow the directions.
